The big theme of this opening passage is that these are not (as traditionally understood) the Acts of the Apostles, but the Acts of King Jesus - if Luke's first volume was all about what Jesus "began to do and to teach" (1:1), then the sequel continues the story. Jesus is still the main actor, even though he will be physically absent from 1:9 onwards. And here he sets the trajectory not only of the book of Acts, but of the rest of human history. If Luke 24:46 describes Jesus' earthly ministry, 24:47 describes his heavenly ministry - repentance and the forgiveness of sins must be preached to all nations in order to complete Jesus' work and usher in the new creation. That's the programme the disciples are commissioned to undertake in Acts. The Day of the Lord has come as they realise in 1:6, but it extends to all nations and to the end of time (1:8) - and with the assurance of their risen King now ascended and ruling from heaven (1:9 - c.f. Daniel 7) and the promise of the Holy Spirit to empower them (1:8), now is not the time to stand around looking for Jesus (1:10-11)! He will return - there is no need to doubt that - and so they must crack on with the mission he has given them. The gospel they proclaimed has, wonderfully, reached us 3000 miles away and 2000 years later; and we too have the privilege of playing our part in the Jesus' mission to build his church.]]></description><link>unite\unite-2024\main-talks\main-talk-1-the-church-is-jesus&apos;-mission-(acts-1.1-11).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Unite/Unite 2024/Main talks/Main Talk 1 - The church is Jesus&apos; mission (Acts 1.1-11).md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 13:11:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unite 2024 Main Talk 2 - The church is for Jesus' enemies (Acts 3:11-26)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Then they have 15 minutes or so simply to react to what they've heard in groups with some simple questions to guide the discussion. It's less of a Bible study than a chance to hear God's word read well and get excited for the day's teaching.<br><br>C.f. <a data-href="Bible Seminars - Overview" href="\unite\unite-2024\bible-seminars\bible-seminars-overview.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Bible Seminars - Overview</a><br>These are done in separate age groups but looking at the same passage. The 14-18s can go into more depth, but the leaders of the two age streams ought to work together to make sure the same points are getting across.  More of a "guided Bible study" than a seminar, with light prep to be done by dorm leaders.<br><br>C.f. <a data-href="Dig Deeper Seminars - Overview" href="\unite\unite-2024\dig-deeper-seminars\dig-deeper-seminars-overview.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dig Deeper Seminars - Overview</a><br>This is for 14-18s only - I envisage these seminars looking more at the OT background of what's going on in the section we're looking at each day and drawing out the implications.<br><br>These are fairly self-explanatory I think! The morning celebration I haven't given a specific passage for - happy to change this but I think it'd be a good chance to look back over the week and encourage the YP to get involved in the ongoing Acts of King Jesus!<br><br>Instead of the Q&amp;A on Wednesday afternoon, I'd like to invite one or two people involved in world mission to give a presentation about what they're doing - let the YP see both the joy and the hardships of ministry over the world! ]]></description><link>unite\unite-2024\unite-2024-teaching-timetable.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Unite/Unite 2024/Unite 2024 Teaching Timetable.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 09:11:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
